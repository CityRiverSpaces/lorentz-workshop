# Notebooks for the workshop "Tracing Sustainable Urban River Space Transformations"

This repository contains the computational notebooks used in the "Tracing Sustainable Urban River Space Transformations" workshop on 9 April at Lorentz Center @lambda.

To see a rendered version of the **CRiSp demo notebook**, go to [https://cityriverspaces.github.io/lorentz-workshop/demo.html](https://cityriverspaces.github.io/lorentz-workshop/demo.html)

To use the **CRiSp use case notebook**, follow these steps (assuming there is at least one person in the group familiar with GitHub):

1. Fork this repository;
2. Make a copy of the file [usecase.qmd](usecase.qmd) and rename it to `usecase-TYPE-CASE.qmd` by replacing `TYPE` with `single` or `multiple`, and `CASE` with `CITY_NAME-RIVER_NAME` and `CITY_RIVER_SET_NAME`, respectively;
3. Work together in the group to fill in the template with the chosen use case;
4. Open a Pull Request on the workshop repository to submit your use case and share any issues you encountered while implementing it in the notebook.
